# YOLOv5 Quantized Model Deployment

FastDeploy supports the deployment of quantized models and provides a one-click model quantization tool.
Users can use the one-click model quantization tool to quantize and deploy the models themselves or download the quantized models provided by FastDeploy directly for deployment.

## FastDeploy One-Click Model Quantization Tool

FastDeploy provides a one-click quantization tool that allows users to quantize a model simply with a configuration file.
For a detailed tutorial, please refer to: [One-Click Model Quantization Tool](../../../../../tools/common_tools/auto_compression/)

## Download Quantized YOLOv5s Model

Users can also directly download the quantized models in the table below for deployment.

The data in the above table shows the end-to-end inference performance of FastDeploy deployment before and after model quantization.

- The test images are from COCO val2017.
- The inference time delay is the inference latency on different Runtime in milliseconds.
- CPU is Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6271C, GPU is Tesla T4, TensorRT version 8.4.15, and the fixed CPU thread is 1 for all tests.
